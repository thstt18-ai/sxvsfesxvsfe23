It appears that you're attempting to initialize a new Hardhat project in a directory that already contains an existing Hardhat project (indicated by the presence of a  file).

Steps to Resolve the Issue
Check Current Project Setup: Since you're already in a Hardhat project, you don't need to initialize another one. Instead, you can simply modify the existing setup or work within it.

Use Existing Configuration: Open your  and make any necessary adjustments or add any required plugins or configurations based on your needs.

Verify Existing Dependencies: Ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can either update them or add missing ones directly in the  if they are not yet included.

Example Modifications
If you need to update your existing  to include additional plugins like hardhat-contract-sizer and @typechain/hardhat, here's how you can modify it:

import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";
import "hardhat-contract-sizer"; // Add this line
import "@typechain/hardhat"; // Add this line
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: "0.8.0",
  contractSizer: {
    alphaSort: true,
    runOnCompile: true,
  },
  networks: {
    hardhat: {},
  },
};
export default config;
Next Steps
After making the necessary adjustments, you can run the commands to install dependencies and compile the project:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run compile
